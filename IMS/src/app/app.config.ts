/*The file app.config.ts is typically used in standalone 
Angular applications to define the application-wide configuration. 
It replaces some of the setup that used to be done in AppModule in traditional Angular apps.

It centralizes the configuration for things like:

Routing (provideRouter)
HTTP client setup (provideHttpClient)
Interceptors (like JWT token handling)
Change detection settings (provideZoneChangeDetection)
Any other global providers your app needs
