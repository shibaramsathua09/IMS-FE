/*ðŸ§© What is a Decorator in Angular?
A decorator is a special function in TypeScript that adds metadata to a class, 
method, property, or parameter. In Angular, decorators tell Angular how to treat a class or element.
@component: marks a class as component
@injectable:marks a class as service that can be injectable
@NgModule: Defines an angular module 
@Directive make a class as directive



ðŸ§© What is a Directive in Angular?
A directive is a class that adds behavior to elements in the DOM. It can change how elements look, behave, or interact.

âœ… Types of Directives
Component â€“ A directive with a template (like AppComponent)
Structural Directive â€“ Changes the DOM structure (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor)
Attribute Directive â€“ Changes the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle)
<div *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome!</div>
