   /*This is a generic interface used to represent paginated data 
   â€” data that is split across multiple pages (like search results, product listings, etc.).
   This interface helps you:

Standardize how paginated data is handled across your app.
Easily manage pagination logic in your frontend.
Communicate clearly with APIs that return paginated results.

When you call an API that returns paginated data, you use PagedResult<T> to type the response.
